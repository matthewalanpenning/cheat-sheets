########## Puppet Hiera ##########
#lookup() searches through global, then environmental, and final module hiera configurations for values
#lookup	() returns first value it finds, if default value presented in lookup() that is last

#Global hiera file location, can be used in all environments
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml

#Environment hiera file location, contained to only that environment
/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/hiera.yaml


#Module-based hiera file location, contained to only the module
/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/<name>/hiera.yaml

#Referencing data files
-path - single file path
-paths - array of file paths
-glob - shell like glob pattern, multiple files in directory
-globs - array of glob patterns to find files
-uri - uri location
-uris - array of uri locations
-mapped_paths - array that is a collection of values

#backends
